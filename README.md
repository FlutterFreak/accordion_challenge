Lodgify - Flutter Technical Challenge

## Getting Started
1. I have exported figma assets and used exact design specs from figma.
2. I have download Source Sans Pro font and used as font family as required by design in figma board.
3. I have created a data model to consume json data from API
4. I have used flutter_bloc architcture for state mannagement, This helped in seperating business logic from UI completely,
   i was able to know what state application is in at any point in time.I was able to record every single user interaction in
   the application for updating UI where needed.
5. I have built small reusable widgets to make the code efficient and look cleaner.
7. i have also written unit test for Group widget and task widget.
8. I have used a package named percent_indicator for showing progress bar, because building it myself
   would have required a bit more time and effort, hence percentage text in progress bar is a little deviated from design,
   but i tried to match everything else according to figma.
9. I have not used exact paddings and margin from figma at some places so that app looks good on mobile device too,
   as design in figma have more width than a mobile device.

 Steps to run the app:
 1. Clone the github repo with command "git clone https://github.com/FlutterFreak/accordion_challenge.git"
 2. Run command "flutter pub get"
 3. Open any simulator/emulator or Chrome(web) and run command "flutter run" to run the app on device or web
